Cancer remains a leading cause of death in New York. In 2018, the latest year for which Cancer incidence data is available, New York reported 114,373 new cases - the 4th highest in the country [1]. The incidence rate was 472.2 per 100,000 people - the highest among ten states with the most cases. An increased incidence rate points to increased exposure to cancer-causing risk factors. Analyzing geographical Cancer data helps to identify emerging Cancer clusters, understand community screening needs, and direct surveillance efforts. In this project, we explore geographical visualization techniques to better understand the impact of various Cancers on New York's counties. We use New York Department of Health's publicly available Cancer registry dataset to Geovisualize county-wise Cancer data. Using design principles learned throughout the course: DSCI-D590, we improve upon existing cancer visualizations for the State of New York - and discuss the process of creating these visualizations in this paper.
